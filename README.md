### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have experience with TypeScript, React, React Native, AWS, Expo, Node, MySQL, MongoDB.

Currently working on two real world projects:
  - Evenhand - A mobile application to provide employers a platform to provide personalized micro learning in specified topics.
  - Darling Pretty Photography - A web application to allow customers to view and book photography sessions online.

Current Personal Projects:

    - React Native, TypeScript, Expo, AWS Amplify
    - I used this project as a way to familiarize myself with the technologies myself and the team would be using during the development of the Evenhand project.
    - Also a way to to integrate my Dart Scoreboard project into a more convienient mobile platform, for situations when a web browser isn't available.
- Dart Scoreboard

    - My first combined React.js and Node.js project.
