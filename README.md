### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I'm new to coding (approximately 10 months) and my first project, a sudoku solver -> https://adam-paul952.github.io/sudoku-solver/ built with HTML, CSS, Javascript

- My React.js project -> https://dartscoreboard.link , now a usable score calculator for playing darts.

- I've also began learning Node.js, creating a back-end for my dart-scoreboard -> https://github.com/adam-paul952/dart-scoreboard-server
